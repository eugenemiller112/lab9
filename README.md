Overall Description of Lab 9

Due: 5:00PM Friday, October 25, 2019 on OSF

    You will individually:
        import data into R
        tidy the data
        create and transform variables
        create plots of the variables and relationships between variables or create meaningful summaries of the data
        generate “findings”
        write a few sentences in the team report detailing what you did, including which functions from the tidyverse you used.
    As a team, you will produce a lab report in R Markdown. The lab report will include:
        a statement of the overall question you are answering using your dataset(s)
        an explanation of why that question is important or interesting and a deeper explanation of why those reasons are important or interesting
        an explanation of the dataset, including a reference or link to the data and a codebook explaining the variables you used
        who the “pretend” domain expert is (and why they think the overall question is important and interesting)
        a “conclusion” that answers the questions
        a “recommendation” for action and explanation of why implementing the recommendation is important
        a series of “findings” and plots based on individuals’ work that provides support for your overall conclusions and/or recommendation
        a section detailing which team members did what.

Data Science to Solve Problems and Answer Questions

Your team has been hired as data science collaborators by a domain expert to answer an overall question and 4/5 or more sub-questions.
Part 1

Decide who the domain expert is, what the questions are, and what data you would use to answer those questions.
Part 2

Import, tidy, transform, explore, analyze, and visualize your dataset(s) to answer the questions and provide a recommendation for action.
Format and Order for Team Lab Report

Create a team R Markdown document knitted to html and submitted to OSF. Put your team name into the filename of the submitted document.

Your document should be in the following order and have the following sections/subsections:

    Overall team question, why it’s important, and why those reasons are important
    A conclusion answering the main question(s)
    Your team’s recommendation and why implementing it is important for the domain expert who hired you
    A brief description of the dataset(s) you imported, tidied, and analyzed
    A series of individual findings and plots (separate subsections for each team member)
    A brief (one sentence) reflection on the ethics of your data science work. Could your analyses be used to cause harm to some entity? Who will it benefit?
    A summary of who did what and what functions you used.
